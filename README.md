Sketch is a drawing component made to work with [Polymaps](http://polymaps.org/)
and speak [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/).

* supports modern browsers as well as touch devices.
* uses events to incrementally build features, so can be automated cleanly.
* use [node-uuid](https://github.com/broofa/node-uuid) to uniquely identify every geospatial feature
* uses line simplification (from Max Ogden) to reduce feature size

## Authors
